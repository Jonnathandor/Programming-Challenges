## Big-O Notation and Tine Complexity.

- Time complexity is a way to evaluate how fast an algorithm runs.

- Input size(n) so the biggert the input the more time we need.

- Linear fashion: O(n) where n is the input of the integer.

- Asympotitcally equivalen means that the functions will essentially be equal as n approaches infinity.

- Big-O stands for Big-Order

From Slowest to fastest

- O(n!)
- O(2n)
- O(n2)
- O(nlogn)
- O(n)
- O(logn)
- O(1)
