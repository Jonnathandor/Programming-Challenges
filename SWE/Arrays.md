## Arrays

- An array is jus a continguous block of memory

- Arrays can consist of any data type

- An array cannot be resized so the initial size cannot be change

- Dynamic resizing array: When the array is full we create another one
  which is double the size of the original, we copy the data and then delete
  the original array

- When it comes to appending new data the worst case scenario
  is O(n)
