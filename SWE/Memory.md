## Memory

- Is how computers store data

# Persistent Memory

- Thisngs like Hard Drive
- Is slower

# Temporary/Non- persistent

- Things like RAM
- Faster

---

- Data in computers is represented in ones and zeros, which immmitate on and off switches
- Any complex data structure we work with is stored in memory

## Heap vs Stack

- Both stored in Ram
- Stack is local memory

  - When we call a function it is stored in its own stack frame
  - The stack frame is pushed into the stack memory

- Heap memory is dynamic memory.
  - This is where large data structures are stored
    - Binary trees
    - Arrays
    - Hash maps
