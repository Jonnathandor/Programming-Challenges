// Java also has booleans and are represented by the boolean type. 
// As in other programming languages booleans only have two values: 
// true or false. 
// Booleans in Java suppport the following operators: 
// !: "Not" which negates the boolean 
// &&: "And" is found in the middle of two booleans and returns true 
// if both booleans are true. 
// ||: "OR" is found in the middle of two booleans and results in true
// if at least one of the booleans is true.
public class Booleans {
    !true // false 
    !false // true
    true && false // false 
    true && true // true
    false || false // false 
    false || true // true
}
