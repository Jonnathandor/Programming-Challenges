public class Strings {
    // In Java world... a string is just an object that represents text. 
    // More specifically an immutable text... but what is text from the 
    // computer point of view?... text is just a sequence of Unicode characters
    // (letters, digits, puntuation, etc.).
    // strings in Java can be defined by using double quotes. 

    String fruit = "Apple";

    // Strings are inmmutable which means that once they are defined: They cannot change. 
    // But Java has a big library that allows you to "manipulate" strings. However; Any method
    // that "seems" to manipulate a string is actually returning a new string. See the String class: 
    // https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html
